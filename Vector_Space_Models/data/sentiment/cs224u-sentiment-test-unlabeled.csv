2705,We ate in the dining room.,0
2706,We went a bit early and avoided the crowd on a Saturday night.,0

2809,"It is a bit of a long walk from the Wiltern, though, about 12+ minutes.",0
2810,"The only very minor issue with service was that some of the bus/wait staff did not speak English very well, so I had to ask them to repeat themselves a couple times.",0
2811,Then on receiving the bill on the night it was 20% more again than the lady had said on the phone.,0

3031,We had reservations for 2:30 P.M. but we were seated at a table well before then.,0
3032,The entree portions are huge and you definitely get what you pay for.,0
3033,The only problem is that more patrons should wear jackets and ties as befitting the quality of the restaurant.,0
3034,"Our meal was $180 - two martinis, corking fee ($10), vodka tonic, 12 oysters, pork entree, goat entree, and desert for 1.",0
3035,One of our favorite restaurants.,0
3036,Nothing more to add.,0
3037,"Honestly... when we sat down and looked at the menu, we didnt know what to order because we had never been to a high class place before and things had different names than what we were used to.",0
3038,The menu is virtually all beef.,0
3039,The economy has changed but they haven't.,0
3040,Waitress spilled some of the champagne we ordered and gave us extra glasses free to make up for it which I thought was a very nice thing to do.,0
3041,We went to this restaurant with high expectations after receiving a rave review from a colleague.,0
3042,Unbelievable!,0
3043,"A small flaw: ice-cold butter, and not nicely herbed, either.",0
3044,Our waiter was clearly unhappy with his job and made it a point not to suggest anything to us.,0
3045,"We were told by many friends, just how good Ciao (Sylvania, OH)is.",0
3046,"Not crazy about the coffee because it tastes like coffee house coffee (strong/bitter)....since I am not reading the newspaper or surfing the web, I don't need liquid coffee bean, I need smooth and relaxing.",0
3047,This was a little disconcerting.,0
3048,I had just set my wine glass down and the server took it and said have a nice night...my companion still have a cocktail in hand.,0
3049,We were not in a rush and we were not hurried through dinner.,0
3050,The Turtle Club is the epitomy of what a beachside restaurant should be.,0
3051,Cocktails were good,0
3052,We had a great dining experience to include help from the server when one of my guests spilled some red wine on her white pants.,0
3053,"That being said, I found our waiter to be excessively catering to several other tables in his area, but not to ours.",0
3054,"If we weren't scheduled to see a program that evening, we probably would have ordered larger steaks and dessert!",0
3055,I wasnt sure if that was to give the sense that the place was busy but only half of the restaurant was used so I would have exected a better seating with spreading people out more and making it more comfortable.,0
3056,"If you're truly craving French food, head over to 'Chapeau' on Clement&3rd where prices are still comparable but chef Phillipe pours his soul into the food.",0
3057,Not very intimate with tables pretty close together.,0
3058,"Also, if you are only going to the resturant you still need a special, free pass from the ticket desk.",0
3059,And we are demanding.,0
3060,Our only complaint was the seat.,0
3061,There wasn't a morsel left on the plate.,0
3062,It is expensive.,0
3063,First time there & I loved it.,0
3064,The other parties that joined me on this visit had never been to La Moora before - I had raved about what a great restaurant this was.,0
3065,We had requested a romantic table and were give one of three table located upstairs that are in a bay window.,0
3066,We got there 6:00 pm and kindly requested a table since we arrived early.,0
3067,This was the first time at the Tribeca location.,0
3068,We drove over to Paia from West Maui and it took me almost 55 minutes.,0
3069,And the noise level did not intrude on our enjoyment of the evening.,0
3070,I requested a table away from the kitchen and a window view.,0
3071,I was told that it is a sometimes on the menu item.,0
3072,I treated my family to dinner on 2.13.10 at Barrio in Saint Paul.,0
3073,Am I in Paris or New York?!,0
3074,"I knew from the start there was a problem with service from the start, when they only brought out one bread dish for a party of seven and we all scrambled for a piece of bread and had to wait ten minutes for a waitress to appear.",0
3075,Would I go back?,0
3076,"I have eaten there before, and it was good.",0
3077,Scrumptious.,0
3078,I BELEIVE THIS RESTAURANT OWES US A COMPLIMENTARY MEAL.,0
3079,The other two ordered off the regular menu.,0
3080,"We have regularly dined at the Culina on 99St and thoroughly enjoy the food and the space, so we were very excited to try Culina Highlands.",0
3081,Really tremendous.,0
3082,We use to go several times and even got engaged there.,0
3083,Only gripe- 13 Euros for a large bottle of sparkling water.,0
3084,A tasting menu would be a very good option for a restaurant of this caliber.,0
3085,The busboy could have used more training on when to remove dishes and other small items.,0
3086,If you expect to be seated on time you might look else where.,0
3087,Thank you very much.,0
3088,Real attitude!,0
3089,"We ordered within 5 minutes of being seated - a salad, a cheese plate and we also orderd our entree at the same time.",0
3090,Obviously this reviewer wouldn't know quality if it smacked them in the face.,0
3091,On Sunday there is a limited selection.,0
3092,Unfortunate!,0
3093,We shared three different flatbreads which was ideal for us.,0
3094,"For more than 20 years, my wife and I have been frequent attendees to the Roof Top Restaurant at the Kennedy Center.",0
3095,I get that.,0
3096,We tried a variety of appetizers and entrees.,0
3097,"We were getting up and getting our own drinks at the bar, napkins, etc.",0
3098,It is just as good for a business lunch as for a dinner when you want to impress friends or colleagues.,0
3099,The cocktails were good.,0
3100,Wanted to go to someplace special for Easter brunch with our family.,0
3101,"I ordered a steak medium, & it came too rare for me.",0

3103,And we are accustomed to New York prices.,0

3105,"The service is very good, they do have free valet parking by the way.",0
3106,The waiter was a little over zealous in suggesting menu items like the sticky buns before lunch & the shrimp salad which was fried.,0
3107,We were there on Valentines Day so it was noiser than usual.,0
3108,When we were ready they still sat our group early.,0
3109,We were seated in the back room which was relatively quiet.,0
3110,"The Palace Cafe is busy every brunch, this V-Day shouldn't be that different.",0
3111,The butternut squash soup has ingredients added at the table so each spoonful is slightly different as they diffuse.,0
3112,We went to the restaurant on St. Patrick’s Day and asked if they had corned beef and cabbage on the menu that night.,0
3113,Every time I go I enjoy the food.,0
3114,"We used to love their other restaurant, Carmel Chop House, and were so sorry to see that it closed.",0
3115,"Thanks for the opportunity to make reservations on line; otherwise, we would have had to wait quite a while!",0
3116,Can't really help that I suppose.,0
3117,The dining experience was great.,0
3118,We arrived a little earlier than our reservation and we reseated immediately.,0

3126,The staff offered me a paper to read.,0
3127,This time we decided to go to the Malibu location.,0
3128,"Because we had a little wait, we were polling people as they were coming down the stairs, off the bar.",0
3129,I made a note of that in the comments section when I booked the reservation through Open Table's iPhone App.,0
3130,It takes a lot to make me cringe when it comes to wine pricing as we are used to great wines but this restaurant did.,0
3131,"The ambiance was subdued although the band in the bar area could be heard in the main dinning room, but it was not a distraction at all.",0
3132,We had a salad that was the candied apple/walnut one.,0
3133,"We were held up 15 minutes due to issues finding parking downtown, and had tickets for a show following dinner.",0
3134,The quality of the fish makes every place else taste bland.,0
3135,We came as a small group and the night just passed by as swiftly as the Chattahoochee.,0
3136,We arrived early at around 5:45 pm so it was relatively quiet.,0
3137,Doing everything right.,0

3163,"The first time we ate there without a reservation, because we were at MAD & appreciated the convenience.",0

3176,"Even though the place was extremely busy, we were sat within a few minutes of arriving.",0

3365,We had Internet reservations for 3:30 pm and arrived promptly.,0
3366,I was looking for something different when my group wanted steak and seafood.,0
3367,"Make a reservation, as I did through Open Table, otherwise you may have a wait on a Friday or Saturday night.",0
3368,On this occasion I brought some out of town guests with me and one of them had an extensive list of food allergies.,0
3369,"The host would not seat them, said they were pretty booked, but offered them a table in the bar.",0
3370,Using the OpenTable.com worked out perfectly for us.,0
3371,"Having guests from DC, who'd been sightseeing and were quite ravenous made the ordeal a bit unbearable and hopefully, Mr. Douglas' folks can change their booking system.",0

3377,Before I went there I read a lot of negative reviews.,0

3389,There weren't many people in the restaurant.,0

3403,Bring your own wine since corkage is reasonable,0
3404,We most certainlly will be eating again at your restaurant.,0
3405,Not too sweet!,0
3406,"The service was friendly, but not indiscreet.",0

3415,The Hurricanes were weak...more like fruit punch so I was disappointed.,0

3421,I went with a group of 4 people and it was all of our 1st time at Tempo.,0
3422,Soda was $3.50 and a cup of regular decaf coffee was $5.00!,0
3423,I have to blame the weather for that and not so much Vergil's.,0
3424,I never spent so much for a meal and been so satified.,0
3425,The restaurant is in a residential part of town.,0
3426,I was glad I had an appetizer(calamari) and the salad was delightful with plenty of bread.,0
3427,Stayed for about two and a half hours with no pressure to leave.,0
3428,"Our reservation was for 9:00, but we were not seated until after 10:00.",0

3431,The interior in Auberge du Lac could have been more charming (especially the wallpaper in the lounge).,0
3432,Noise level was pretty high so very hard to have a conversation.,0

3446,"Had we known, we probably wou7ld have ordered the sample tasting menu since it was comparably priced.",0
3447,Can't be STUFFED when you hit the bars.,0
3448,Not sure on noise rating as only a few people were there at 5:30 when we went.,0
3449,"The downside was the restaurant is quite noisy so with a large group, it's quite difficult to hear.",0
3450,May want to consider a ATM closer to restaurant.,0
3451,I ordered the food from the open table menu.,0
3452,When I mentioned that at the Culver City restaurant they did when I ate there a year or so ago he offered to ask the manager.,0
3453,We chose to dine prior to going to the theater.,0

3458,My husband had to drive the valet parker to the parking space and then walk back to join us.,0
3459,We considered it to be GOOD LUCK !,0
3460,No substitutions are permitted but none were wanted.,0
3461,Combined with the restaurant ambiance (love the red plush booths) it all makes for a wonderful dining experience every time.,0
3462,"The funniest quote, and the funniest I've ever heard from any waiter was, after I handed him my empty plate, I told him that the food was no good, with a wink of course.",0
3463,Not one speck of food was left on any of our plates.,0
3464,Then my guests arrived.,0
3465,"Then, for some reason we didn't go.",0
3466,"In most restaurants, when you order veal parmesan, you get a slightly larger medallion size.",0
3467,What strikes a discordant note is the music which tends toward the contemporary and seems out of place for this gourmet Indian restaurant.,0
3468,Save room for dessert that they make on site.,0
3469,"Our seasoned waiter had perfect timing, but if he happened to be looking the other way, someone else was always watching the tables to respond.",0
3470,The Chef is very creative using local produce.,0
3471,"Innovative, creative with combinations herbs and flavors.",0

3482,Best food we've ever had.,0
3483,"Dinner arrived, filet mignon and a square of potatoes literally.",0
3484,"Because of the note I wrote on Open Table, everyone already knew about her birthday and several of the staff wished her Happy Birthday and generally fussed over her.",0
3485,"Sometimes during restaurant week, I feel like something ends up lacking--whether its the food, or the service since the staff may not want to spend as much time on you as another guest ordering off the regular menu.",0
3486,I did notify on my reservation that it was our 16th year anniversary but they offered nothing special or any recognition.,0
3487,The thought of the waiters not knowing what they serve is ridiculous.,0
3488,A line started forming behind us.,0
3489,"Also, the seating arrangement was too close, we heard everyone's conversations from all sides.",0
3490,The mashed potatos that came along with it left something to be desired however; they were a bit too bland for my tastes.,0
3491,The Palm has always been the venue and we really enjoy it.,0

3518,They didn't seem to be prepared for people arriving at noon.....some with and some without reservations.,0

3526,The atmosphere & service compelled me to leave a larger tip.,0
3527,Unfortunately our food was arriving just as she was signaling to our waiter.,0

3540,We arrived at Boxwood Bistro and little early so we decided to have a drink and an appetizer before we were seated for dinner.,0

3542,"Not this time; the chef seemed to go easy on oil and salt, succeeding in drawing out flavors in every dish.",0
3543,Dessert menu may be too exotic.,0
3544,"Needless to say, there wasn't much talking going on at our table, we were too busy enjoying our selections and everyone else’s too.",0
3545,This particular time we had to share the restaurant with a very rowdy group that was about three tables away but was noisy enough that we eventually could not carry on our conversation and we left.,0
3546,We come at least once or twice every month and the menu is always changing.,0
3547,Reservations can be important as this is a smaller and cozier establishment.,0
3548,"The salmon melted in my mouth, the flesh was so moist and flaky I think that I actually moaned out loud.",0
3549,The only thing negative that I could say is that the tables were a bit too close to one another.,0

3562,"As my whole party was unable to decide between the Lobster Mac & Cheese and anything else, we shared that as an appetizer.",0

3582,Both were subperb.,0
3583,"Although there were many children with families dining for Easter the children's menu was limited to just three items (Grilled Cheese, Pasta w/marinara, Chicken Fingers)which was extremely disappointing, made worse by the outrageous charge of $10 each for these ridiculously cheap meals!",0
3584,Atmosphere a lttle stuffy.,0
3585,"My only suggestion to the restaurant is: they offer a reduced price for ""teens"", which is basically same meal, just no salad.",0
3586,I was concerned because I read some bad reviews on the food.,0
3587,This is not our first time to the vault and will not be the last.,0
3588,The only drawback was that the check was wrong and had different prices than what was on the menu.,0

3595,Hope they get it together.,0
3596,At the end it doesn t come cheap for a dinner that you dont even recall the day later,0
3597,"Valentine's Day at a nice restaurant can be a daunting experience - the restaurant is overbooked, there is a wait for the table even though you made the reservation weeks in advance, the service is minimal at best, and the food is not what you ordered.",0

3600,A little disappointed because there were no specials due to Springtini.,0
3601,I have long wanted to dine at L'Atelier Joel Robuchon.,0

3603,"The onion rings were disappointing, but it was more of a personal preference issue for me.",0
3604,It would be great if the chef could create similar dishes with a substitute for the pork.,0
3605,These people arrive after me and had a later reservation.,0
3606,"The spaetzle was good, but if you've had spaetzle before, you know it can be a little bland unless it's paired with other veggies, which BLT did well by adding shaved brussel sprouts and onions.",0
3607,Place gets loud when full - so thpose with hearing impairment will sit clueless at the same table.,0
